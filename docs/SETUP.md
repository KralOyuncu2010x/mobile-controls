# INSTALLATION

For stable versions, use this

```
haxelib install mobile-controls
```

For unstable versions however, use this

```
haxelib git mobile-controls https://github.com/KralOyuncu2010x/mobile-controls
```

Once this is done, go to your Project File, whether that be a build.hxml for Haxe Projects, or Project.xml for OpenFL and Flixel projects, and add `mobile-controls` to your libraries
